# PSONeuralNetwork

In this project i will implement the techniques i learned in [ParticleSwarmOptimization](https://github.com/MichaelVerdegaal/ParticleSwarmOptimization), and use PSO to optimize the weights of a neural network. I'll see how this stacks up versus the default optimizers, and a combined approach.

I will work out the [Mobile phone price prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dewangmoghe/mobile-phone-price-prediction), chosen because it's small, and requires little cleaning. 

## Installation

Installation is done with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (although pip is
possible too for fallback purposes).

- run `poetry install`
- run `pre-commit install`
- optionally, add more packages using `poetry add <package>`
